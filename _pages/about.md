I am currently an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Western Michigan University. I am interested in 
developing novel machine learning models to analyze data with complicated structures, especially in the area of clustering and classification.
In particular, I have been developing models for high-dimensional 
categorical and directional data. The applications of my research include text mining, pattern discovery, 
image processing, and business process modeling.

I am actively looking for motivated students and potential collaborators. The topics lie broadly in the span of statistics and machine learning. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have an interest!
