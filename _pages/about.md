I am currently an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Western Michigan University. I am interested in 
developing novel machine learning models to analyze data with complicated structures, with an emphasis 
on the area of clustering and classification. In particular, I have developed models for high-dimensional 
categorical and directional data. The applications of my research include text mining, pattern discovery, 
image processing, and business process modeling.
